# Create Conda Environment with Miniconda
I am creating a Conda environment for DESeq2 data analysis 
with R and Bioconductor in my windows systems using Windows 
Subsystem Linux (WSL)

## code in WSL terminal
- start the WSL in windows
- Type the following to create a conda environment for R4.5 name as R4.5WS 
```{cmd}
conda create --name R4.5WS
```
- Activate the R4.5WS conda environment as follows
```{cmd}
conda activate R4.5WS
```
